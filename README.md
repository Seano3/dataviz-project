# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the population for a handfull of neghboring towns on the South Shore of Massachutes. 


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How much does the population change over time?
 * Are the changes in population the same or at least simmular in all of the towns?
 * What events could have led to the big changes in population?
 * Do town spefic population events affect the population neghboring towns?

## Sketches

This sketch shows two ideas I had for visulazing the population data. The three diffrent colored lines represent theree diffrent towns. The Left graph shows population over time and the right graph shows % Change in population each year. The % Change could be more intersting if there is a large diffrence between the populations of the town. However, it does not show as much information that just the population graph. 


## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a line plot and it shows the population of the town of Cohasset, located on the South Shore of Massachutes.

After this I created another graph with 3 additional nearby towns

Additionaly I alse created a % change graph using the same data

## Progress Updates

This Week I collected more towns data for the visulazation. I think that more data will make the graphs more intersting to look at. Im still floating the ideas of which type of graph I want to go into but I think with more data the % change graph might start to loose the bennifits it has. It might possible be a good idea to instead use a line graph for it instead of a bar graph. I plan to experament with this next week.

### 1/8/2025

For this week I had the idea to visualize the data has a map as were woring with real life towns. My idea of to have the population number in the town and change the color of the town based on the % change for the year. To get here I made a prototpye a series of boxes rather than the map. This can be found here :

This was a fun proof of concept with the slider working correctly and it sucessfuly showed the real pop of each of the towns without drowning out some of the smaller ones. I think I will move fowars in this direction for the remainder of the project. 




## Milestones

Each Week I would like to come up with new ideas to display this data and also collect more datasets showing diffrent towns populations. 

### 1/8/2025

Next week I want to shape these boxes into the town map for the shouth shore of MA and I will also need to collect the data for the rest of the towns in the region. After that I want to look into visualizing the total population in the map instead of just having the number there.
