# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the population for a handfull of neghboring towns on the South Shore of Massachutes. 


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How much does the population change over time?
 * Are the changes in population the same or at least simmular in all of the towns?
 * What events could have led to the big changes in population?
 * Do town spefic population events affect the population neghboring towns?

## Sketches

This sketch shows two ideas I had for visulazing the population data. The three diffrent colored lines represent theree diffrent towns. The Left graph shows population over time and the right graph shows % Change in population each year. The % Change could be more intersting if there is a large diffrence between the populations of the town. However, it does not show as much information that just the population graph. 


## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a line plot and it shows the population of the town of Cohasset, located on the South Shore of Massachutes.

After this I created another graph with 3 additional nearby towns

Additionaly I alse created a % change graph using the same data

## Progress Updates

This Week I collected more towns data for the visulazation. I think that more data will make the graphs more intersting to look at. Im still floating the ideas of which type of graph I want to go into but I think with more data the % change graph might start to loose the bennifits it has. It might possible be a good idea to instead use a line graph for it instead of a bar graph. I plan to experament with this next week.

## Open Questions

Im still very unsure which of the two ideas I want to move foward with for my graph. Thankfully it is very easy to convert between % Cange and just the numbers. 

## Milestones

Each Week I would like to come up with new ideas to display this data and also collect more datasets showing diffrent towns populations.
