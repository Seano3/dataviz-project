# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the population for a handfull of neghboring towns on the South Shore of Massachutes. 


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How much does the population change over time?
 * Are the changes in population the same or at least simmular in all of the towns?
 * What events could have led to the big changes in population?
 * Do town spefic population events affect the population neghboring towns?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)


## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a line plot and it shows the population of the town of Cohasset, located on the South Shore of Massachutes.

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
